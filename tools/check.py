# receipts reference checker — v0.2-draft
# Verifies pointer integrity of a receipts sidecar file by sampling.
# Semantic support (DISPUTED) is a judgment for the sampling reader;
# this tool gets you to the raw thing and tells you whether it's intact.
#
# Usage:
#   python3 check.py <report>.receipts.jsonl [--sample N] [--seed S] [--all]
#                                            [--today YYYY-MM-DD] [--strict]
#   python3 check.py --coverage SPEC.md DECISIONS.md
#
# Verdicts per receipt: OK | CHANGED | MISSING | UNREADABLE | UNFETCHED
# (superseded receipts are resolved first; only the current set is sampled
# unless --all is given). Failing marks: STALE, UNWITNESSED. A human
# `disputed` annotation is reported and not computed. Exit code 0 iff every
# sampled receipt is OK, carries no failing mark, and is not disputed.
# A run whose every checked receipt is UNREADABLE or UNFETCHED is a loud
# failure: non-zero exit and a diagnostic line, not a pass.
#
# What this checker implements of SPEC v0.2-draft (§9 asks a tool to say):
#   §4.1   required fields, including source.uri; ids unique in the file.
#          sha256 is compared to the bytes actually hashed: the source.lines
#          region when that narrowing was applied under form_used, otherwise
#          the whole source. source.span has no format and is ignored; the
#          output says so.
#   §5.1   machine verdicts OK / CHANGED / MISSING. DISPUTED is a human mark:
#          reported when the receipt carries `disputed` (true, or a non-empty
#          string), never computed. Not part of machine core.
#   §4.2   canonical / form_used (Kama #forge narrowing, PR edit): absent, or
#          the draft name "raw-bytes", means whole-source raw bytes. Known
#          forms this tool can reproduce: raw-bytes and lines-utf8-nl (the
#          §4.1 line-range rule). A line-range / non-raw verdict MUST name
#          the form hashed under (source.form_used, or source.canonical when
#          it is not the whole-source default). Undeclared form when lines
#          apply → UNREADABLE. Declared form this tool cannot reproduce →
#          UNREADABLE. Hash matches only under another known form than the
#          one named → UNREADABLE (not OK, not CHANGED). Verdict detail
#          surfaces form_used=…. UNREADABLE is a draft name.
#   §4.2   UNFETCHED (draft name): a URL or URN this checker did not fetch.
#          Not MISSING, and not UNREADABLE.
#   §6     a receipt supersedes only a receipt on an earlier line ("later"
#          is file order, not the date field). A supersedes that names nothing
#          in the file, itself, or a later line is warned and ignored (an
#          error under --strict). It does not supersede.
#   §7     review_by is YYYY-MM-DD. STALE once --today is strictly after that
#          date and no later receipt supersedes it (the only "review recorded"
#          this tool can see). It does not check that review_conditions were
#          written before the date.
#   §5.2   sampling_warrant is a line of this check-report, not a field on
#          each receipt: the run licenses nothing about receipts it did not read.
#   §11    kind names the class. UNWITNESSED only for kind "read" (§11.3):
#          subject is not the authorizer, and witness is absent, not a string,
#          is the reader or the authorizer, or (when party_registry is set)
#          does not resolve in that registry. party_registry is @grok draft
#          (Kama #forge narrowing): local path, one party id per line.
#          Absent party_registry: transitional string-compare; the report
#          notes that no registry was bound. window is YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD
#          and is not checked against a time. subject does not make a receipt
#          a read.
#   §4.6   draft normative names, @grok's proposal, not an adopted decision.
#          Missing every-receipt names: warnings by default, errors with --strict.
# Not implemented: UNREAD, SELF-READ, UNTESTED, UNBOUNDED, SELF-REPORTED,
# BOUNDED, WITNESSED, UNRECORDED, CLAIMED, and the §11.9 (intent)
# UNWITNESSED. kind selects the class (authorization and intent included),
# but no decision names those artifacts' fields, and this checker does not
# invent them.
# Scheduled emission (§5.4) is outside one run. The check-report goes to
# stdout, not a receipts file. Who fixed party_registry (third party neither
# authorizer nor witness) is not checked by this tool; only resolution is.
#
# Coverage (--coverage, SPEC §0 "Fold source"; Lume and Kama #forge cuts,
# conventions of the draft, not D-numbers): a D-number is closed when
# DECISIONS.md heads it "## D-0NN ·" (open entries are "## Open ·"). Every
# closed D-number must be cited in SPEC §1–§11 (from "## 1." up to the
# "Open questions" section) or listed under "### Dropped"; every D-number
# cited there or dropped must be closed; none may be both. Each closed
# D-number needs an Appendix B fold-source line equal (whitespace folded)
# to its DECISIONS.md **Source:** line. Exit 0 iff no gap.
#
# Narrowing: source.lines "A-B" selects lines A..B (1-based, inclusive) of
# the file decoded as UTF-8 (bad bytes replaced), joined with "\n", with no
# trailing newline, re-encoded as UTF-8. Draft form name: lines-utf8-nl
# (§4.1 / §4.2). source.span is not applied.
